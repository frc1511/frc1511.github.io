## Description

WPILib is the general software library/toolkit that we use to program the robot. It does not include functionality to control many of the hardware components on the robot, but it does contain the basic tools needed to setup the robot program and handle the majority of the robot's tasks.

WPILib installs a custom version of Visual Studio Code, along with several utility apps and libraries needed to code, compile, and deploy robot programs.

## Installation

* [Installer Download](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases/latest)

A detailed step-by-step installation guide can be found [here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html).

It is important to update WPILib whenever a new version is released to ensure that we don't run into any compatibility issues when running code on the robot.
