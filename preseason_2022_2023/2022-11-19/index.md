## Description

Hi! Today we will be learning about how to get input from Game Controllers to control functionality of the robot and look at some more sensors!

## Game Controllers

The primary way we control our robot is through game controllers (XBox Controllers, PS4 Controllers, Logitech Controllers, etc.). We can read values from the joysticks and buttons on the controllers to do things. Often we will also use a "Switch Panel", a board with buttons and switches that we can use to configure properties of the robot which can be addressed just like buttons on a controller.

For information on how to read input from game controllers, see [this page](/robot_programming/controls/#hid) on Human Interface Devices (HID).
