# December 4th Pre-Season Meeting

* [Description](#description)

## Description

Today we will be starting to apply the skills that we've learned so far to re-program our 2019 robot. This will be a great opportunity to practice what we've learned so far and get a sense of what it is like to work with a group of people on a single codebase.

The goal for today is to start programming code for Controls and the Drivetrain. Make sure to reference the [Controls page](/robot_programming/controls/) for information on how to read input from game controllers, and the [Mechanisms page](/robot_programming/mechanisms/) for information on how to create mechanisms.
