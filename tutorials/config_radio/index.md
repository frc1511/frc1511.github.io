# Configuring the Radio

The robot's radio is used to route data between the robot and the computer's driver station.

There are a few circumstances where the radio needs to be re-configured, including:

1. Brand new radios need to be configured before they can be used.
  - This process is a tad more complicated because you have to load the radio's firmware onto it, then configure it.
2. Following a competition, the radio needs to be re-configured in order to once again connect wirelessly to the driver station.
  - Pretty simple. The radio just needs to be configured with the ssid and team number.
