# Configuring the Radio

The robot's radio is used to route data between the robot and the computer's driver station.

There are a few circumstances where the radio needs to be re-configured, including:

1. New radios need firmware loaded onto them, then need to be configured.
2. Following a competition, the radio needs to be re-configured in order to once again connect wirelessly to the driver station.

To see detailed instructions on how to program the radio, see [this page](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-3/radio-programming.html).
