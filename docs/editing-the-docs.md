# Editing the Docs

This website uses [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to generate the site html from markdown files.

To make changes, follow these steps:

1. Create a branch of the [Git Repository](https://github.com/frc1511/frc1511.github.io).
2. Make your changes (add/edit markdown files in `docs/`). Use Visual Studio Code or your favorite text editor.
    - If you add a new page, make sure to add it to the `nav:` section of `mkdocs.yml` so it shows up in the site navigation.
    - To add abbreviations, add them to `includes/abbreviations.md`.
    - For markdown syntax help, see this [markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
    - To learn about mkdocs-material features, see the [mkdocks-material reference](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/).
3. To preview the site, you must first [install mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/#installation), then [serve the site locally](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/creating-your-site/#previewing-as-you-write).
4. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub.
5. Create a pull request on GitHub to merge your branch into the `main` branch.
6. Somebody will review your changes then approve and merge the pull request.
7. After merging, your changes should show up on the site in a few minutes.
