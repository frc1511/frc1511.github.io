# Running ThunderAuto Trajectories & Auto Modes on the Robot

The easiest way to run ThunderAuto trajectories and autonomous modes on your robot is to use [ThunderLib](../thunderlib/index.md) to load the ThunderAuto project files and provide a simple API for running trajectories and auto modes. ThunderLib also provides support for receiving [Remote Project Updates](remote-updates.md) from ThunderAuto.

Alternatively, you can export individual trajectories to CSV files from ThunderAuto and load them on the robot manually. See the [Exporting Trajectories to CSV Files](trajectories.md#exporting-trajectories-to-csv-files) section for information about exporting trajectories.
