# WPILib

## Description

> The WPI Robotics Library (WPILib) is the standard software library provided for teams to write code for their FRC® robots. WPILib contains a set of useful classes and subroutines for interfacing with various parts of the FRC control system (such as sensors, motor controllers, and the driver station), as well as an assortment of other utility functions.

## Documentation

- [WPILib Official Documentation](http://docs.wpilib.org/)
    - Includes tutorials and examples for most common robot tasks.

## API Reference

- [C++ API](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/index.html)
- [Java API](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/index.html)

## Installation

- [Latest Installer Download](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases/latest)

Download the installer for your operating system and run it. Follow the [official installation instructions](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html) details.

It is important to update WPILib on all team computers whenever a new version is released.

A new major WPILib version is released before every FRC season a few days before kickoff. Major versions include new features, improvements, and bug fixes, and often change or deprecate existing functionality. It is important to review their [yearly changelog](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/yearly-overview/yearly-changelog.html) to see what has changed. Robot code projects created with older versions of WPILib must be updated to the latest version before being able to be built and deployed to robots. This can be done in WPILib VSCode.

There are usually a few mid-season updates to WPILib as well to fix critical bugs. No new features will be added mid-season, so compatibility should not be an issue. It is important to update to these versions as soon as possible to avoid issues.
