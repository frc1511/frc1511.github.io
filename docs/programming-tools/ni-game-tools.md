# NI Game Tools

## Description

The FRC Game Tools include the following software:

- FRC Driver Station 
      - Used to connect to the robot and control it.
- LabVIEW 
- FRC roboRIO Imaging Tool & Images
      - The roboRIO image version coincides with the version of [WPILib](wpilib.md), and therefore must match for things to work properly. The imaging tool can be used to flash roboRIO V1 devices. Use a tool such as [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to flash the image to SD cards used in roboRIO V2 devices.

## Installation

- [Installer Download](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/drivers/download.frc-game-tools.html)

It is important to update the FRC Game Tools whenever a new version is released to avoid compatibility issues.
