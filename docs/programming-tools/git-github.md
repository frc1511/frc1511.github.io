# Git + GitHub

## Description

Git is a version control system used to track changes in source code. Git allows us to incrementally save changes to our code as "commits", which can be reverted later if needed. Git makes it easy to collaborate with multiple programmers on the same codebase. Our code repositories are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/frc1511).

## GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop is a graphical user interface for Git that makes it easy to check out repositories, make commits, and push changes to GitHub.

For instructions on installing and setting up GitHub Desktop, see
[Getting Started With GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop)

## VSCode Git Integration

On the Welcome Page in VSCode, use the __:fontawesome-solid-code-branch: Clone Git Repository__ button to clone a repository from GitHub.

To manage a Git repository, use the Source Control tab labeled __:fontawesome-solid-code-branch:__ on the sidebar. Here you can pull changes from GitHub, view local changes, stage changes for commit, make commits, and push changes to GitHub.

## Git Command Line 

Git can also be used from the command line. For instructions on installing Git and using it from the command line, see [Git - Getting Started](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
