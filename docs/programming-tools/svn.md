# SVN

## Description

Subversion (SVN) is a version control system used to track changes in source code, similar to Git. 1511 previously used SVN for version control from 2007 to 2022 before switching to Git+GitHub in 2023. Our SVN repositories for past seasons are stored at [svn.penfieldrobotics.com](http://svn.penfieldrobotics.com). To get yourself a login, ask one of our programming mentors.

## Setup

See the [SVN Setup Guide](https://wiki.penfieldrobotics.com/wiki/index.php?title=SVN_Setup) on the team wiki for instructions on installing TortoiseSVN and checking out repositories.
