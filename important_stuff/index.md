## Miscellaneous

Some useful things to remember:
* Camera Server Port is 1181 ([link](http://roborio-1511-frc.local:1181/stream.mjpg))
* Limelight Port is 5801 (for configuration), 5800 (for stream)
* Color sensor proximity reading ranges from 0-2048, the higher the value the closer the surface. A reading of ~300 or greater is enough for a reliable color read
