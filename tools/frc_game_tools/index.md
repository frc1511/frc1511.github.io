# FRC Game Tools

## Description

The FRC Game Tools are used for controlling the robot and configuring the roboRIO.

The FRC Game Tools include the following software:
* FRC Driver Station
  - Used to connect to the robot and control it for testing and competition.
* LabVIEW
  - We don't use LabVIEW.
* FRC roboRIO Imaging Tool & Images
  - The roboRIO image version coincides with the version of [WPILib](/tools/wpilib/), and therefore must match for things to work properly. The imaging tool helps flash the roboRIO with the correct image.

## Installation

* [Installer Download](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/drivers/download.frc-game-tools.html)

A detailed step-by-step installation guide can he found [here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/frc-game-tools.html).

It is important to update the FRC Game Tools whenever a new version is released to ensure that we don't run into any compatibility issues!
