# Subversion (SVN)

* [Description](#description)
* [Setup](#setup)

## Description

Subversion (also called "SVN"), is a version control system used to keep track of changes to our source code. SVN allows us to incrementally “commit” our code changes, allowing us to have a comprehensive history of the codebase. When working on a project with others, SVN can help merge people’s code changes together and help maintain a centralized version of the codebase.

The SVN code repositories from previous years are stored at [svn.penfieldrobotics.com](https://svn.penfieldrobotics.com).

## Setup

Detailed instructions about how to setup SVN can be found [here](https://wiki.penfieldrobotics.com/wiki/index.php?title=SVN_Setup).
